# Soccer Club Website
This is the landing webpage for the website of a soccer club. This webpage was created using HTML and CSS.

## What I learned while doing this project:

### Header

- Position of the header is fixed and z-index set to 1 so the header can stay at the top of the page while scrolling through page.
- Header is positioned top and left of 0 so it takes up the left corner.
- Border around text by putting the text inside a div tag and selectively styling the text.

### Banner

- Two parts to the banner - img and text inside image
- Both these elements are contained inside a parent section tag.
img was first resized to a max-width of 100% so it will adjust to window size
- The parent section tag's position was made to be relative
- The text was positioned to be absolute so it is removed from normal document flow and placed absolutely inside its parent container (section).
